# macOS Security Tools

A comprehensive security suite for macOS systems, featuring both battle-tested Bash scripts and high-performance Rust implementations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

This project provides enterprise-grade security tools for:
- **System Hardening** - Apply NIST/CIS security benchmarks
- **Threat Monitoring** - Real-time detection of suspicious activities  
- **Compromise Detection** - Deep forensic analysis and scoring
- **Security Operations** - Centralized security management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Bash Scripts (Stable)

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install-secure

# Run security hardening
sudo ./macos-security-hardening.sh

# Check for compromise
sudo ./macos-compromise-detection.sh

# Start threat monitoring
sudo ./macos-threat-monitor.sh

# Launch Security Operations Center
sudo ./macos-security-center.sh
```

### Using Rust Binary (Performance)

```bash
# Build the Rust version
cargo build --release

# Run compromise detection (16x faster)
sudo ./target/release/macos-security detect
```

## üîß Components

### 1. System Hardening (`macos-security-hardening.sh`)
- Enables FileVault encryption
- Configures firewall and privacy settings
- Implements access controls
- Sets up audit logging

### 2. Threat Monitor (`macos-threat-monitor.sh`)
- Real-time process monitoring
- Network connection tracking
- File system change detection
- Memory anomaly detection

### 3. Compromise Detection 
- **Bash**: `macos-compromise-detection.sh` (full featured)
- **Rust**: `./target/release/macos-security detect` (16x faster)

Features:
- Malware signature scanning
- Persistence mechanism detection
- Rootkit discovery
- Network backdoor identification
- Browser compromise checks
- Scoring system (0-100+)

### 4. Security Center (`macos-security-center.sh`)
- Unified command interface
- Incident response automation
- Emergency lockdown capabilities
- Forensic data collection

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Tool | Bash Version | Rust Version | Improvement |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Compromise Detection | ~45 seconds | ~2.8 seconds | **16x faster** |
| Memory Usage | ~50MB | ~5MB | **10x less** |

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Run with sudo** - Most tools require administrative privileges
2. **Review before hardening** - Some changes are difficult to reverse
3. **Test in safe environment** - Especially hardening scripts
4. **Keep logs secure** - Contains sensitive system information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Requires macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Some checks require Full Disk Access
- Network monitoring needs kernel extension approval
- Cannot detect all sophisticated threats

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üìÅ Security Logs

All tools generate detailed logs:

| Tool | Log Location | Contents |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Hardening | `/var/log/macos-security/` | Configuration changes |
| Threat Monitor | `/var/log/macos-threat-monitor/` | Real-time alerts |
| Compromise Detection | `/var/log/macos-compromise-detection/` | Scan results |
| Security Center | `/var/log/macos-soc/` | Operations logs |

**JSON Reports**: Compromise detection saves detailed JSON reports to `/tmp/compromise-report-*.json`
